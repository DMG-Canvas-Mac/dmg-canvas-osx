## What is DMG Canvas?  

**DMG Canvas** is a professional **macOS disk image builder** that gives developers full creative control over their installer designs. It allows you to transform a standard DMG file into a polished, branded experience for distributing software in a clean and visually engaging way.  

Unlike traditional command-line tools, DMG Canvas provides a **visual workspace** for arranging icons, adding backgrounds, and setting window layouts. This makes the process fast, intuitive, and consistent â€” ideal for developers who need to produce high-quality DMG packages without manual scripting.  

Users can incorporate **custom artwork, text instructions, and license agreements**, as well as control mounting behavior and file organization. It also integrates directly with **code signing and notarization workflows**, ensuring that the finished DMG meets modern macOS security and usability standards.  

Whether youâ€™re preparing a commercial product or a personal project, DMG Canvas delivers a reliable and professional solution for presenting your app to users in a refined and branded way.
